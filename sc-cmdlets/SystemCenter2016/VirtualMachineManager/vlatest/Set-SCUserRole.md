## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-SCUserRole** cmdlet modifies the settings for an existing Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) user role.
The settings that you can modify depend on the type of VMM user role.

The types of user roles are as follows:

VMM Administrator (Administrator)

You can add members to or remove members from the Administrator user role.
You cannot limit the scope of objects that members of this role can manage.

Delegated Administrator (DelegatedAdmin)

You can add members to and remove members from a Delegated Administrator user role.
You can expand or restrict the scope of a Delegated Administrator user role.
You can grant members of this user role permission to manage all of the objects in private clouds and host groups.
You can allow users to manage all of the objects stored on library servers.
Within that framework, you cannot limit the actions that members of the Delegated Administrator user role can perform.

Read-Only Administrator (ReadOnlyAdmin)

You can add members to and remove members from a Read-Only Administrator user role.
You can expand or restrict the scope of a Read-Only Administrator user role.
However, the members of the user role can only view the properties, status, and job status of the objects within their assigned scope.
They cannot modify any of the objects.

Self-Service User (SelfServiceUser)

You can add members to or remove members from a Self-Service user role.
You can expand or limit the scope and actions of members of a Self-Service user role.
You can grant members of a Self-Service user role permission to manage all of the objects in private clouds.
You can grant permission to create virtual machines, permission to store virtual machines in the stored virtual machine path in the cloud that the virtual machine is on, and permission to use template objects to create virtual machines.
Within that framework, you can grant members of a Self-Service user role actions that self-service users can take.
You can also limit the number of virtual machines that self-service users can create by setting a quota that applies to each user or to all users collectively. 

The actions that you can grant a self-service user include the following: 

- AllowLocalAdmin.
Grants user local administrator rights on virtual machines. 
- Author.
Author virtual machine and service templates.
- CanShare.
Share resources with other Self-Service users.
- CanReceive.
Receive resources from other Self-Service users.
- Checkpoint.
Create and manage virtual machine checkpoints.
- CheckpointRestoreOnly.
Can only restore a checkpoint.
- Create.
Create virtual machines and services from templates only.
- CreateFromVHDOrTemplate.
Create virtual machines and services from virtual hard disk (VHD) files or templates.
- PauseAndResume.
Pause and resume virtual machines and services.
- RemoteConnect.
Remotely connect to virtual machines.
- Remove.
Remove virtual machines and services.
- Save.
Save virtual machines and services.
- Shutdown.
Shut down virtual machines.
- Start.
Start virtual machines and services.
- Stop.
Stop virtual machines and services.
- Store.
Store virtual machines in a library.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Add users to the VMM Administrator user role
```
PS C:\> $UserRole = Get-SCUserRole -Name "Administrator"
PS C:\> Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $UserRole -AddMember "Contoso\User01","Contoso\User02"
```

The first command gets the user role object named Administrator, and then stores that object in the $UserRole variable.

The second command adds User01 and User02 to the Administrator user role.
Both users are members of the Contoso.com domain.

### Example 2: Add users to the Administrator role by using the pipeline
```
PS C:\> Get-SCUserRole -VMMServer "VMMServer01.Contoso.com" | where { $_.Profile -eq "Administrator" } | Set-SCUserRole -AddMember "Contoso\User03"
```

This command gets all user role objects from VMMServer01, selects the user role objects whose profile is Administrator, and then adds User03 to the Administrator user role.

### Example 3: Modify an existing Self-Service user role by adding a cloud to its scope
```
PS C:\> $Cloud = Get-SCCloud -Name "Cloud02"
PS C:\> $UserRole = Get-SCUserRole -Name "ContosoSelfServiceUsers"
PS C:\> Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $UserRole -AddScope $Cloud
```

The first command gets the cloud object named Cloud02, and then stores that object in the $Cloud variable.

The second command gets the user role object named ContosoSelfServiceUsers, and then stores the object in the $UserRole profile.

The last command modifies the scope of the user role stored in $UserRole by adding the cloud stored in $Cloud to its scope.

### Example 4: Remove the specified user from the Administrator user role
```
PS C:\> $UserRole = Get-SCUserRole -Name "Administrator"
PS C:\> Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $UserRole -RemoveMember "Contoso\User01"
```

The first command gets the user role object named Administrator, and then stores that object in the $UserRole variable.

The second command removes User01 from the Administrator user role.
User01 is a member of the Contoso.com domain.

### Example 5: Add a cloud to the scope of a Self-Service user role
```
PS C:\> $Cloud = Get-SCCloud -Name "Cloud03"
PS C:\> Get-SCUserRole -Name "ContosoSelfServiceUsers" | Set-SCUserRole -AddScope $Cloud
```

The first command gets the cloud object named Cloud03, and then stores that object in the $Cloud variable.

The second command gets the user role object named ContosoSelfServiceUsers, and then passes that user role object to the current cmdlet.
This cmdlet adds the cloud stored in $Cloud to the user role.

### Example 6: Modify what actions members of a Self-Service user role can take on their virtual machines
```
PS C:\> $UserRole = Get-SCUserRole -VMMServer "VMMServer01.Contoso.com" -Name "ContosoSelfServiceUsers"
PS C:\> Set-SCUserRole -UserRole $UserRole -Permission "Create,PauseAndResume,Stop,AllowLocalAdmin,Store"
```

The first command gets the user role object on VMMServer01 named ContosoSelfServiceUsers, and then stores the object in the $UserRole variable.

The second command modifies the permissions for members of the user role stored in $UserRole to allow Creation, PauseAndResume, Stop, AllowLocalAdmin, and Store permissions.
